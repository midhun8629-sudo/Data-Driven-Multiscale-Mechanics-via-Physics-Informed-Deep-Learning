# Data-Driven-Multiscale-Mechanics-via-Physics-Informed-Deep-Learning
Project: Data-Driven Multiscale Mechanics via Physics-Informed Deep Learning Developed a non-intrusive Reduced Order Model (ROM) to accelerate multiscale simulations of heterogeneous composite materials.
---
Methodology: Combined Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to map macroscopic strain tensors directly to microscopic stress fields.

Results: Achieved 0.24% relative error against analytical micromechanics solutions while reducing inference time by orders of magnitude compared to traditional FEA homogenization.

Application: Enabled real-time prediction of fiber-matrix interface failure, facilitating rapid design optimization of composite microstructures.

Tools: PyTorch, Python, NumPy, Scientific Machine Learning (SciML).
